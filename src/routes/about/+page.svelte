	<p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
		Are you fueled by pedal power and the call of the open road? Do you find solace under a canopy
		of stars, your trusty bike resting beside your humble tent or minimalist bivvy? If the whisper
		of the wind through grass is your preferred lullaby, then you've rolled into the right place.

	<p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
		This little corner of the web is dedicated to the fine art of <span
			class="italic font-medium text-emerald-700">sleeping on the floor</span
		> – gloriously, adventurously, and often, quite literally. It's for the intrepid souls exploring
		the country one campsite, hidden clearing, or friendly patch of earth at a time.
	</p>

	<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">Find Your Patch, Share Your Story</h2>

	<p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
		Here, you can discover spots shared by fellow travelers – from established grounds to those
		secret gems perfect for an overnight pause. More importantly, it's a place to share your own
		tales from the trail: the perfect sunrise view from your sleeping bag, the unexpected kindness
		of a stranger offering their lawn, or the hilarious challenge of setting up a tent in the dark.
		Let's build a map of memories, one floor-sleep at a time!
